6. AI-powered Reviews (improve code quality)

User Role Management and QR Code Generation are complete and now considered baseline.

## Notes

- Features should be implemented one at a time
- Each feature should have its own branch and PR
- Tests should be written alongside feature implementation
- Documentation should be updated for each feature
- Accessibility should be considered throughout implementation
- Database migrations added:
  - `0002_add_user_roles.sql` (roles + RLS)
  - `0004_create_poll_shares.sql` (share analytics + RLS)
