### Step-by-Step Testing

#### 1. **Create Admin User** 
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com');
```

#### 2. **Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
# Server now running on http://localhost:3001 (if 3000 is in use)
```

**Steps:**
